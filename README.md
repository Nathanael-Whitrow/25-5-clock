# 25+5 Clock

The 25+5 Clock is a web application that helps you manage your time effectively using the popular Pomodoro Technique. It provides a simple and customizable timer system that alternates between work sessions and short breaks, allowing you to maintain focus and productivity.

## How it Works

The 25+5 Clock consists of two adjustable timers: a 25-minute work timer and a 5-minute break timer. You can set the desired durations based on your preference and work style. Once started, the clock will automatically switch between the work and break phases, signaling you to start and stop tasks accordingly.

The concept behind the 25+5 Clock is to break your work into manageable intervals, promoting concentration and preventing burnout. By dedicating focused work sessions followed by short breaks, you can maintain productivity, improve time management, and avoid fatigue.

## Features

- Customizable work and break durations to suit your needs.
- Clear visual indicators for work and break phases.
- Audible notifications to signal the start and end of each phase.
- Option to pause, resume, or reset the timer as required.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls.

## Getting Started

To use the 25+5 Clock, simply open the web app in your browser. Adjust the work and break durations using the provided controls. Click the start button to initiate the timer and begin your work sessions. Make sure to follow the prompts and take breaks when indicated to maximize your productivity.

Start managing your time effectively and staying focused with the 25+5 Clock!
